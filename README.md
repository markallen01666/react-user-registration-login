## React authentication app

Test app for login components built using React and Hooks - based on 'codedamn' Youtube video 'Firebase + React HOOKS Authentication tutorial' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_wZCW6wXIo)

I've then stripped out unnecesary guff and tidied up code to make a more generic login module that can be used as a basis for building authenticated apps.

To activate, a Firebase project needs to be setup and the appropriate config info copied into firebase.js
The Firebase authentication method 'email and password' must be enabled
